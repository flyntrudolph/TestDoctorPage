> “I have been home for three days now and am still just amazed at how quickly the surgery went. Just four nights ago (before surgery), I had to lift my leg up each stair; take over 5 mins to get up from a chair, and getting in and out of shower was a lengthy process. Now, to be able to do all of these things normally is just FANTASTIC!! This surgery has given me back MOTION!!”
