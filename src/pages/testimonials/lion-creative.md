> “Dr. Wildstein operated on my back after I had been to 3 other back surgeons who told me they couldn’t do anything for me. He was kind, considerate, and spent so much time with me and my wife explaining exactly what he would do in the operation to try and help fix my back pain and what to expect along the way. My operation was 4 months ago and I am now cured of my back and leg pain and a normal human again. He is a miracle worker!"
